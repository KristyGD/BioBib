## Course Description

This interdisciplinary course introduces students to the rapidly evolving field of Digital Humanities (DH), where humanistic inquiry meets computational methods and digital technologies. Students will explore how digital tools can enhance research, teaching, and public engagement in the humanities while critically examining the theoretical foundations and ethical implications of digital scholarship.

Through hands-on projects, collaborative work, and critical analysis, students will develop both practical skills in digital tools and theoretical understanding of how technology shapes knowledge creation in the humanities.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- **Analyze** the theoretical foundations of Digital Humanities and its relationship to traditional humanistic inquiry
- **Apply** digital tools and methods to humanities research questions
- **Create** original digital scholarship projects using appropriate technologies
- **Evaluate** digital humanities projects critically, considering both technical implementation and scholarly contribution
- **Reflect** on the ethical, social, and political dimensions of digital scholarship
