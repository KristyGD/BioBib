**[B. Contributions in the 5 major areas of librarianship:]{.mark}**

> [[Selection and Development of resources]{.underline}]{.mark}
>
> **[S&E Library Ground Floor Renovation Project]{.mark}**
>
> [February 2021 - September 2023]{.mark}
>
> [For this project, I acted as one of the library\'s 3 representatives
> on library needs alongside Greg Careaga and Marcus Thayer. I
> represented the programmatic needs of the now open Digital Scholarship
> Innovation Studio to ensure that the design elements of the projects
> met the needs of the project. I participated in the selection of the
> contractor, provided feedback on the blueprints and plans, identified
> the appropriate equipment for the programmatic expansion, and worked
> with vendors to select the furniture for the new space. As mentioned
> in my self review, this process directly relates to the feeling of
> inclusion and openness that the space provides.]{.mark}
>
> **[DSI Programming Development]{.mark}**
>
> [Fall 2021 - Fall 2024]{.mark}
>
> [Alongside the renovation of the space, I worked to develop the
> programming that would go alongside the physical space. The goal was
> to create a welcoming space that provided support for students to use
> the equipment. In particular, I focused on creating a student worker
> structure that prioritized peer to peer support at any stage of
> learning. I also created a system for patron training that took into
> account relevant health and safety concerns alongside creating a
> process that would create the highest likelihood of student success
> and learning over time. I successfully advocated for and received an
> additional full time appointment for a staff position to support
> patron training and equipment maintenance.]{.mark}
>
> **[DSI Equipment Upgrade]{.mark}**
>
> [Summer 23]{.mark}
>
> [Equipment in the digital scholarship space is always changing and
> being updated. My role is to make sure that the equipment that we
> update in our spaces has a clear need based on campus usage. In
> addition to staying current with what type of equipment is available,
> I collect regular usage data to identify what needs we are currently
> meeting and what gaps exist. For this upgrade, I identified a new 3D
> printer that had a faster print time and was easier and safer to use,
> increasing the potential for patron access. I also identified that we
> were at capacity for the current usage of our equipment, indicating
> the need to increase accessibility specifically to 3D printers. I used
> this data to successfully advocate for the replacement of our existing
> 3D printers and identified an appropriate home on campus for the
> equipment no longer in use.]{.mark}
>
> **[Library 360 tours]{.mark}**
>
> [I have continued to support the library in the process of making our
> spaces more understandable online through the use of 360 photography
> and online tour creation. In addition to using ThingLink, which is a
> tool that has expanded is support for screen reader accessibility, I
> have also used "". I have created or mentored student work in creating
> the following 360 resources:]{.mark}

> [[Reference and advisory service]{.underline}]{.mark}
>
> **[Undergrad Fellowship Program]{.mark}**
>
> [I act as one of the three librarian mentors for our undergraduate
> fellows and directly mentored four undergraduate students during this
> time. During this review period, I also worked to identify which
> digital scholarship team member would be most appropriate to take the
> lead in this program rather than leading the program myself. This
> creates a leadership opportunity within the department. My mentorship
> role has primarily been around supporting digital projects including a
> digital zine, a project around text analysis of political messaging,
> and two digital exhibits.]{.mark}
>
> **[Consultations]{.mark}**
>
> [I have completed 88 consultations over the course of this review
> period. These consultations covered topics including:]{.mark}

- [The use of digital scholarship tools such as Timeline JS, Omeka,
  Google SItes, and Story Maps for integration into class
  assignments.]{.mark}

- [Repeating collaborations with Gerald Moulds, Kate McQueen, and Kate
  Jones around developing and scaffolding specific digital assignments
  in their class. These included additional training for DSC Student
  Assistants to provide peer to peer support for their classes.]{.mark}

- [Consultations on digital tools including Omeka, Photogrammetric 3D
  scanning, and 3D printing using sustainable materials for research
  projects.]{.mark}

- [Consultations with graduate students around collecting and managing
  digital data for research projects.]{.mark}

> **[Class Visits]{.mark}**
>
> [I visited 24 classes as a guest lecturer. Of particular note is a now
> standing guest lecture I provide for Gerald Molds' CSE-3 Computing
> Technology in a Changing Society course to discuss critical making
> theory. This lecture and it's associated quarter wide assignment are
> part of a two year collaborative process on integrating DSI specific
> technology into a critical making assignment for the students. This
> class directly integrates the values of learning through the making
> process and incorporates failure as a valid pathway to learning based
> on my feedback. Also of note was a collaboration with Tad Leckman for
> CMPM 179 - Playable Learning in VR Practicum, where I worked with a
> group of students providing them with the framework for them to
> develop a pitch on 3D printing training in a virtual environment. This
> assignment created an opportunity for students to practice real world
> skills as a part of their assignment.]{.mark}
>
> **[Campus support]{.mark}**
>
> [On campus, I am frequently asked to provide consultation and support
> for other programs that engage with digital scholarship. In
> particular, I have supported the Graduating and Advancing New American
> Scholars program for the past two years during their summer
> orientation program. I have also provided program level consultation
> for the newly opened Slugworks makerspace, the new online only
> Creative Technologies major, and the Humanizing Technology program.
> Additionally, I have supported 7 events on campus as a representative
> of the library.]{.mark}
>
> [[Library non-managerial administrative duties]{.underline}]{.mark}
>
> [I have focused my efforts on inclusivity (ensuring the work we do is
> accessible regardless of where people are), expanding opportunities
> for real-world applications of digital scholarship skills through
> developing professionalization pathways, expanding efficiencies in the
> workflows that benefit students and staff ability to support the
> vision of the work, and amplifying student voices.]{.mark}
>
> **[New Librarian and Staff Mentorship]{.mark}**
>
> [Two new positions were hired into the Library Center for Digital
> Scholarship in summer of 2023. As part of their onboarding process, I
> developed a series of new documentation to help them understand my
> vision for supporting student learning through access and pedagogical
> support. I also worked to scaffold their onboarding to avoid
> overwhelming them with the scope of the work that my team supports.
> This approach was a more structured approach than I have previously
> taken and was directly influenced by the leadership mentorship that I
> have participated in over the past review session.]{.mark}
>
> **[Events]{.mark}**
>
> [I have focused on increasing accessibility to our events over the
> past review cycle. The main goal of our events is to increase campus
> familiarity with the broad scope of digital scholarship happening on
> campus. The yearly Digital Scholarship Symposium also provides
> opportunities for students to present their work in a professional
> venue that has a public audience. Where possible, I work to make sure
> that events such as our Symposium can be held in a hybrid format and
> recordings are made available after the event. For 2023, I
> experimented with incorporating a short pitch from each of our
> showcase exhibits. I also provided support for an additional 26
> smaller events and workshops, including Open house events in 2022 and
> 2023 and the S&E Naming Event in Fall of 2022.]{.mark}

> **[DSI Student Training Program]{.mark}**
>
> [Winter 2022 - Fall 2023]{.mark}
>
> [For this project, I updated the internal training program for the DSI
> Student assistants to better align with library values for student
> opportunities that connect to real world skills and provide practical
> experience as part of the training. The training for each student
> takes 10 weeks in fall to complete, where they learn to use the
> equipment alongside existing workers and focus on scaffolding their
> skills. The training incorporates specific sessions talking about the
> philosophy of the work we do in digital scholarship and how to support
> others. They first learn a piece of equipment and then, once they are
> confident with that equipment, we discuss how to support others. In
> Fall of 2022, I also advocated for and received two positions that
> were student lead positions. These positions have more
> responsibilities around running workshops and maintenance and
> increased student engagement in the space. The positions are also more
> highly paid and provide an opportunity for growth for existing student
> workers or an opportunity for students who have existing experience to
> bring to the position.]{.mark}
>
> **[DSC Student Assistant Skill Paths]{.mark}**
>
> [Summer 2021]{.mark}
>
> [I reconfigured our DSC Student Assistant positions to have specific
> skill paths. This re-framing of their work provided more explicit
> project support for librarian projects and more hands-on opportunities
> for the student workers to practice their skills and develop specific
> skill sets while still engaging with a shared set of introductory
> level skills to support. It also provided more direction for the
> students beyond focusing on specific classes we were supporting.
> Previously, our DSC positions were focused on general digital
> scholarship support. The new process provides a specific skill set for
> each student paired with a librarian who has knowledge about that
> skill set. Currently, we have four students (social media, digital
> exhibits, audio/video editing, and 3D modeling).]{.mark}
>
> **[Social Media Project]{.mark}**
>
> [Summer 2022]{.mark}
>
> [I developed a proposal to create a social media program within the
> Digital Scholarship program that was focused on specifically creating
> a student voice for our social media. As part of our Digital
> Scholarship Student assistant updating, one of the current students
> was put on a social media skill path. Over the summer of 2023, I
> mentored the student in a project where she reviewed current social
> media best practices and created a plan of action for the 23/24
> academic year. This is a different approach than we have taken in the
> past, which was geared more towards advertising and less towards
> creating space for student voices. The instagram handle for this
> account is \@ds_ucsc.]{.mark}

> [I have continued to serve as floor marshal for the library's
> emergency response team. I have found this especially helpful in my
> work at S&E, where there are far fewer staff on site. In particular,
> it has influenced the way that we train our DSI students and lead
